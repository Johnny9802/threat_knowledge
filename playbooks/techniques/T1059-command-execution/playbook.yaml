hunt_hypothesis: |
  Adversaries frequently abuse built-in Windows command-line interfaces and scripting
  interpreters to execute malicious code, evade defenses, and maintain persistence.

  This playbook hunts for:
  1. Obfuscated PowerShell commands (base64, encoding, download cradles)
  2. Suspicious command-line execution patterns (LOLBins, encoded commands)
  3. Script execution from unusual locations (temp, public, appdata)
  4. PowerShell downloading and executing remote content
  5. Command-line execution with suspicious parent processes
  6. WScript/CScript abuse for malicious VBScript/JScript

  We focus on patterns that deviate from normal system administration activities,
  particularly commands executed by non-admin users or from unexpected parent processes.

queries:
  splunk: queries/splunk.spl
  elastic: queries/elastic.kql
  sigma: queries/sigma.yml

investigation_steps:
  - Examine the full command line for obfuscation, encoding, or suspicious flags
  - Identify the parent process and execution chain to understand how the command was launched
  - Check if the user account typically executes such commands (baseline behavior)
  - Look for file creation, network connections, or registry modifications following execution
  - Search for similar commands executed on other endpoints (lateral movement)
  - Analyze PowerShell script block logs (Event ID 4104) for full script content
  - Check for persistence mechanisms (scheduled tasks, registry run keys)
  - Review process memory for injected code or suspicious modules

false_positives:
  - Legitimate system administration scripts run by IT staff
  - Automated deployment and configuration management tools (SCCM, Ansible)
  - Software installation and update processes
  - Security tools and EDR agents using PowerShell for monitoring
  - Developer workstations running build and test scripts
  - Scheduled tasks for system maintenance
